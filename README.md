## Key Insights from Dashboard

### General Weather Conditions

Per the dataset, the predominant weather conditions in this specific location throughout 2012 showcased a prevailing pattern of cloudiness, accounting for approximately 43.2% of observed weather patterns. Following closely, clear weather encompassed 39% of the recorded conditions, with less common occurrences involving rain and fog, constituting around 7% of the dataset.

### Temperature Extremes

In 2012, the dataset recorded noteworthy temperature extremes. The highest temperature of the year occurred in April, peaking at 32.8 degrees Celsius. In stark contrast, the lowest temperature plummeted to a bone-chilling -23.8 degrees Celsius in January.

### Winter Weather

Throughout the winter months of December, January, and February, which collectively represent roughly 20% of the year, the weather assumed a distinctive character characterized by snowy and hazy conditions. Minimum temperatures during this period ranged from -23 to -14 degrees Celsius, often under overcast skies.

### Summer and Rain

In contrast, the months of July, August, and November generally featured predominantly clear skies. Nevertheless, it's noteworthy that occasional heavy rain and thunderstorms occurred in July, introducing an element of variability to the otherwise clear summer months.

### Extended Cloudy Period

The majority of the year, spanning September and October (comprising 51% of the total time), was typified by prolonged periods of cloudy skies.

### Winter Wind Impact

During the winter season, the region experienced notably brisk average wind speeds, typically ranging between 8 to 24 km/h. Notably, when wind speeds exceeded the 20 km/h threshold, particularly when coupled with the naturally low temperatures of December, it frequently triggered the occurrence of snow and haze, amplifying the distinct character of winter weather.
